# Talk Further Challenge

## [SQL Task](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1eEac7X-JRnl9k9W9nv8LNkKyBOGBR8Tu)

## I am most familiar with PostgreSQL so the syntax follows that more closer than MySQL or SQL.

### Create Tables
- Create `country` table
```
CREATE TABLE country (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY generated by default as identity,
country_name VARCHAR(255),
code VARCHAR(3)
);
```

- Create `author` table
```
CREATE TABLE author (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY generated by default as identity,
firstname VARCHAR(100),
lastname VARCHAR(100),
country_id INTEGER,
FOREIGN KEY (country_id) REFERENCES country(id)
);
```

- Create `book` table
```
CREATE TABLE book (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY generated by default as identity,
author_id INTEGER,
FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES author(id),
title VARCHAR(255),
isbn BIGINT
);
```

- Create `bookdetails` table
```
CREATE TABLE bookdetails (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY generated by default as identity,
  book_id INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES book(id),
  price DECIMAL(10, 2),
  discount DECIMAL(10, 2),
  is_hard_copy BOOLEAN
);
```

## Tasks - Implement queries

1. List authors(id, first_name, last_name, country_name), book name, ISBN, price, discount, is_hard_copy if they have books, or null if they don't.
    - Order by author last_name, first_name.
```
select distinct a.id, a.firstname, a.lastname, c.country_name, b.title, b.isbn, bd.price, bd.discount, bd.is_hard_copy
FROM author as a, country as c, book as b, bookdetails as bd
WHERE a.id = b.author_id
and b.id = bd.book_id
and c.id = a.country_id
group by a.id, a.firstname, a.lastname, c.country_name, b.title, b.isbn, bd.price, bd.discount, bd.is_hard_copy
ORDER BY a.lastname, a.firstname;
```
2. List authors (id, first_name, last_name, country_name) where country code is the USA.
```
SELECT author, c.country_name
FROM author, country as c
WHERE author.country_id = c.id
and c.code ILIKE 'USA'
GROUP BY author, c.country_name;
```

3. List authors(id, first_name, last_name, country_name) with books.
    - Order by the number of books descending.
```
SELECT a.id, firstname, lastname, c.country_name, b.title
FROM author as a, country as c, book as b
where a.id = b.author_id
and a.country_id = c.id
GROUP BY a.id, firstname, lastname, c.country_name, b.title
order by b.title DESC;
```

4. Select how many books are from USA authors.
```
select c.country_name, count(*)
FROM author as a, country as c, book as b
where a.id = b.author_id
and c.id = a.country_id
and c.code = 'USA'
GROUP BY c.country_name;
```

5. Select books (title, isbn, discount, price) where 20 <= discount <=30, order by price
    - increasing.
```
select title, isbn, discount, price
from book as b, bookdetails as bd
where b.id = bd.book_id
and bd.discount between 20 and 30
ORDER by bd.price asc;
```

6. List the cheapest book (price) of every author (first_name, last_name).
    - If an author does not have books, display -1 as the price.
```
select firstname, lastname, price
from book as b, bookdetails as bd, author as a
-- Subquery to filter min price of book matching bookdetails matching author
where bd.price = (
select min(price)
from bookdetails
where a.id = b.author_id
and b.id = bd.book_id
)
group by firstname, lastname, price;
```
